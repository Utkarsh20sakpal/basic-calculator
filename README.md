# basic-calculator
This project is a simple yet functional web-based calculator developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a clean interface to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 


##  How It Works

1. User clicks buttons which update the input display.
2. JavaScript listens for click events and builds an expression string.
3. The `eval()` function evaluates the expression when `=` is clicked.
4. The `âˆš` button calculates the square root using `Math.sqrt()`, with error handling for negative inputs.


## Future Improvements

- Keyboard support for input.
- Advanced operations like exponents and brackets.
- Light/Dark mode toggle.
- Use `math.js` library for more secure and robust expression parsing.
- Improved mobile responsiveness and animations.
